# Nashville_Traffic_accident_analysis
Executive Summary
Traffic accident analysis is an important part of enhancing road safety and reducing incidents in Nashville. I can identify trends by examining various aspects such as 1) temporal patterns, 2) spatial distribution, 3) contributing factors. The finding can lead to implement effective interventions to prevent and reduce loss by Traffic accident.
Motivation
My motivation of this project is to enhance road safety in Nashville by providing data-driven insights to policymakers and the public in an interactive application. A user can explore accident data to understand the pattern of traffic accidents and contributing factors. The information will encourage safer driving behavior and make Nashville’s road safer for all users.
Data Question
1. To determine if specific traffic accident patterns occur in certain areas at particular times of the day,
2. Whether some different factors contribute to accident occurrences.

	 	 	 	
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. Display Historical Accidents on an Interactive Map
•	Data Visualization: Utilize geospatial analysis to plot historical accident data on an interactive map. This visualization can highlight accident hotspots and temporal patterns.
•	Detailed Pop-ups: Enhance the map with pop-ups that provide specific details for each accident, including:
o	Number of motor vehicles involved
o	Number of injuries
o	Illumination status at the time of the accident
o	Weather conditions during the incident
2. Analyze and Predict Accident Trends
•	User-Selectable Filters: Allow users to filter data based on:
o	Weather Conditions.
o	Time of Day: Morning, afternoon, evening, night
o	Illumination Conditions
•	Bar Charts: Display the distribution of the number of motor vehicles involved under various conditions.
•	Line Charts: Illustrate time-based trends, such as the number of accidents per month, to identify seasonal patterns or long-term changes.
3. Predictive Modeling (will add it if there is enough time)
•	Objective: Develop models to predict the likelihood of accidents based on:
o	Weather Conditions: Utilize historical weather data to assess risk under various scenarios.
o	Time and Location: Analyze temporal and spatial data to identify high-risk periods and areas.
o	Other Contributing Factors: Consider variables such as traffic volume, road conditions, and driver behavior.
•	Methodology: Employ machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression or neural networks, to build predictive models.
